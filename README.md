## Contribute

Feel free to submit pull requests, they will be merged as long as they pass the tests.
Do not hestitate to submit issues or vote on them if you want a feature implemented.

### Contribute Rulings (non-developers)

Please do not hestitate to contribute rulings: all help is welcome.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/issues)
with a ruling you think should be added,
provide a link to an online post by one of the rules directors:

- From 2016-12-04 onward, [Vincent Ripoll (ANK)](http://www.vekn.net/forum/news-and-announcements/75402-new-inner-circle-vekn-board-of-directors#79470)
- From 2011-07-06 onward, [Pascal Bertrand (PIB)](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.trading-cards.jyhad/VzRGZO_Iuto/BjJGRVvJ5Z8J)
- From 1998-06-22 onward, [L. Scott Johnson (LSJ)](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.trading-cards.jyhad/RIX1tLgOFjg/xKikfSarfd8J)
- From 1994-12-15 onward, [Thomas R Wylie (TOM)](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.trading-cards.jyhad/Dm_gIP3YvUs/qTyKyq2NWv4J)

### Contribute Rulings (developers)

Feel free to contribute rulings as Pull Requests directly, this is very appreciated.

Add the ruling link to
[rulings-links.yaml](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/blob/master/src/rulings-links.yaml),
and the ruling itself to
[cards-rulings.yaml](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/blob/master/src/cards-rulings.yaml) or
[general-rulings.yaml](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/blob/master/src/general-rulings.yaml)
depending on the case.

The format is mostly self-explanatory:

- Cards are reference by ID and name in the format `ID|Name`.
- Card names inside rulings text should be between bracers, eg. `{.44 Magnum}`
- Individual rulings in `cards-rulings.yaml` must provide one or more references
  to ruling links at the end of the text, between brackets, eg `[LSJ 20100101]`

In doing so, please follow the following guidelines:

- Keep the YAML files clean and alphabetically sorted (you can use a YAML formatter)
- Make the rulings as concise as possible
- Prefix the ruling with the discipline level and/or type the ruling applies to (if any),
  eg. prefix with `[PRO] [COMBAT]` if the ruling applies only to the card played in combat at superior Protean.
- Adapt the ruling wording to the cards it applies to (ie. use masculine/feminin forms)
- You can run the tests with the `pytest` command to check everything is OK

## Installation

You need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
installed on your system to use this tool in command line.

Use pip to install the ``krcg`` tool:

```shell
pip install krcg
```

Then initialize the tool using the ``init`` subcommand:

```shell
krcg init
```

## Usage

Use the help command for a full documentation of the tool:

```shell
krcg --help
```

And also extensive help on each sub-command:

```shell
krcg [COMMAND] --help
```

Note most commands only take decks from 2008 on in consideration.
You can use the `--from` and `--to` parameters to control the date range.

## Examples

Get a card text (case is not relevant,
some abbreviations and minor misspellings will be understood):

```shell
$> krcg card krcg
KRCG News Radio
[Master][2P] -- (Jyhad:U, VTES:U, CE:U, LoB:PA, LotN:PG, KoT:U/PB, SP:PwN1 - #101067)
Unique location.
Lock to give a minion you control +1 intercept.
Lock and burn 1 pool to give a minion controlled by another Methuselah +1 intercept.
```

This provides rulings, if any:

```shell
$> krcg card ".44 magnum"
.44 Magnum
[Equipment][2P] -- (Jyhad:C, VTES:C, Sabbat:C, SW:PB, CE:PTo3, LoB:PO3, FB:PTr2 - #100001)

```shell
$> krcg card -l ".44 magnum"
.44 Magnum
[Equipment][2P] -- (Jyhad:C, VTES:C, Sabbat:C, SW:PB, CE:PTo3, LoB:PO3, FB:PTr2 - #100001)
Weapon: gun.

## Static files generator

In its development version, KRCG also offers a tool for generating static files
for third parties, `krcg-gen`.

```shell
krcg init
krcg-gen standard amaranth
```

will generate files in the static directory for `standard` and `amaranth` third parties.
