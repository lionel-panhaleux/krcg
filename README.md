A Python package build to serve as an interface for
the VEKN [official card texts](http://www.vekn.net/card-lists)
and the [Tournament Winning Deck Archive (TWDA)](http://www.vekn.fr/decks/twd.htm).

It also contains an ever-growing list of cards rulings, that is kept up to date
thanks to the hard work of our contributors.

## Offspring projects

The KRCG library has been used in multiple _offpsring_ projects:

-   [krcg-cli](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg-cli) is a convenient
    Command Line Interface over the library

-   [krcg-static](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg-static)
    is used to generate easy-to-use static files for web developers.
    It is available online at [static.krcg.org](https://static.krcg.org)

-   [krcg-api](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg-api)
    is a free RESTful web API exposing to get the most out of the library for web project.
    It is available online at [v2.api.krcg.org](https://v2.api.krcg.org)

-   [krcg-bot](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg-bot) is a friendly Discord bot
    that provides official card text and rulings for free.
    It is [available for free](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=703921850270613505&scope=bot).

## Installation

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required.

Use pip to install the `krcg` tool:

```bash
pip install krcg
```

## Using the library

KRCG is a Python library for VTES.
The code is well-documented and can be explored using Python's built-in `help` function.

Here are a few quickstart examples to showcase how the library can be used:

### VTES

`krcg.vtes.VTES` is the cards library. It needs to be loaded using the `VTES.load()`
method. Note that this loads the data from the
[KRCG static](https://static.krcg.org) server, where it's already available
in JSON format for free, for anyone who would want to play with it.

Alternatively, you can use `VTES.load_from_vekn()` if you want to load directly
from the official [VEKN CSV files](https://www.vekn.net/card-lists),
although that's a bit slower. That's actually the way [krcg-static] does it to generate
the static JSON files used for the standard load.

Then you can play around with VTES to access cards, complete card names or search.

```python
>>> from krcg.vtes import VTES
>>> VTES.load()
>>> VTES["Alastor"].to_json()
{
  'id': 100038,
  'name': 'Alastor'
  '_name': 'Alastor',
  'url': 'https://static.krcg.org/card/alastor.jpg',
  'types': ['Political Action'],
  'card_text': (
    'Requires a justicar or Inner Circle member.\n'
    'Choose a ready Camarilla vampire. If this referendum is successful, '
    'search your library for an equipment card and place this card and the equipment '
    'on the chosen vampire. Pay half the cost (round down) of the equipment. '
    'This vampire may enter combat with any vampire controlled by another Methuselah '
    'as a +1 stealth Ⓓ action. This vampire cannot commit diablerie. '
    'A vampire may have only one Alastor.'),

### TWDA, Analyzer and Deck

`krcg.twda.TWDA` is the interface to the TWDA. It needs to be loaded in the same way
as the `VTES` instance, using the `TWDA.load()` method. That time, using
`TWDA.load_from_vekn()` instead is considerably slower.

Once loaded, it can be used to browse the decks in it.

```python
>>> from krcg.twda import TWDA
>>> TWDA.load()
>>> TWDA["2019ecday2pf"]
<Deck #2019ecday2pf: Finnish Politics>
>>> print(TWDA["2019ecday2pf"].to_txt())

>>> len([d for d in TWDA.values() if date(2019, 1, 1) < d.date < date(2020, 1, 1) and d.players_count >= 25])

```

The `krcg.analyzer` can provide some statistics over a collection of decks:

```python
>>> from krcg.analyzer import Analyzer
>>> # You can analyze the whole TWDA, or a fragment of it, or any collection of decks
>>> A = Analyzer([d for d in TWDA.values() if date(2019, 1, 1) < d.date < date(2020, 1, 1)])
>>> # A blank refresh will provide basic statistics
>>> A.refresh()

 (<#100698 Fame>, 0.6666666666666667)]
```

The `krcg.seating` module provides functions to compute optimal seatings:

```python
>>> from krcg import seating
>>> # permutations gives you the list of players for each round
>>> seating.permutations(12, 3)
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]]
>>> # things get funny when you have 6, 7 or 11 players: you need more rounds
>>> # but not all players play every round
>>> seating.permutations(7, 3)
[[4, 5, 6, 7],
 [1, 2, 3, 7],
 [3, 4, 5, 6],
 [1, 2, 6, 7],
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
>>> # you can use the Round class to get tables from the permutations
>>> [seating.Round(p) for p in seating.permutations(14, 3)]
[[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14]],
 [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14]],
 [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14]]]
>>> # and the optimise function to search for an optimal seating
>>> result, score = seating.optimise(seating.permutations(12, 3), iterations=50000)
>>> result
[[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]],
 [[2, 9, 6, 10], [12, 8, 1, 5], [3, 7, 4, 11]],
 [[11, 5, 10, 1], [6, 4, 12, 7], [8, 3, 9, 2]]]
>>> # score.rules gives a score over the nine official rules for optimal seating
>>> score.rules
[0, 0, 0.0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1.118033988749895, 2]
>>> # you can inspect violations individualy
>>> # for example rule #4 (players are opponents twice) has 9 violations, to see them:
>>> score.R4
[[1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 9], [3, 4], [4, 7], [5, 8], [6, 7], [9, 10], [10, 11]]
>>> # for more details about the Score structure, check the docstring
>>> help(seating.Score)
```

And finally, the `krcg.deck.Deck` class can be useful to parse and manipulate any deck.

```python
>>> from krcg.deck import Deck
>>> with open("First_Blood_Nosferatu.txt") as f:
>>>     deck = Deck.from_txt(f)
>>> deck.crypt

## Contribute

Feel free to submit pull requests, they will be merged as long as they pass the tests.
Do not hestitate to submit issues or vote on them if you want a feature implemented.

### Design considerations

The package uses no database by design.
The TWDA, search engine and cards dict are kept in memory for better performances.
The whole library generates a memory footprint between 128MB and 256MB.

The package uses external data sources for card list, so that it needs not be updated
when new sets are released or official VEKN CSV files are changed: it can use
new data sets as soon as they're available.

### Contribute Rulings (non-developers)

Please do not hestitate to contribute rulings: all help is welcome.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/issues)
with a ruling you think should be added,
provide a link to an online post by one of the rules directors:

-   From 2016-12-04 onward, [Vincent Ripoll (ANK)](http://www.vekn.net/forum/news-and-announcements/75402-new-inner-circle-vekn-board-of-directors#79470)
-   From 2011-07-06 onward, [Pascal Bertrand (PIB)](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.trading-cards.jyhad/VzRGZO_Iuto/BjJGRVvJ5Z8J)

### Contribute Rulings (developers)

Feel free to contribute rulings as Pull Requests directly, this is very appreciated.

Add the ruling link to
[links.yaml](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/blob/master/rulings/links.yaml),
and the ruling itself to
[rulings.yaml](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/blob/master/rulings/rulings.yaml).
You can define groups of cards in
[groups.yaml](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/krcg/blob/master/rulings/general-rulings.yaml)
if it's relevant.

The format is mostly self-explanatory:

-   Cards and groups are reference by ID and name in the format `ID|Name`.

-   Card names inside rulings text should be between bracers, eg. `{.44 Magnum}`.
    It needs to be a full card's name (ie. not `{Praxis Seizure}` but `{Praxis Seizure: Dublin}`)
    to enable online tools to successfully parse for (and display) actual cards.

-   Individual rulings in `rulings.yaml` must provide one or more references
    to ruling links at the end of the text, between brackets, eg `[LSJ 20100101]`

-   Cards listed in a group in `groups.yaml` can indicate a list of symbols prefix if
    only one of their variant (superior, merged, etc.) is to be considered as part of the group 

In doing so, please follow the following guidelines:

-   Keep the YAML files clean and alphabetically sorted (you can use a YAML formatter)

-   Make the rulings as concise as possible

-   Prefix the ruling with the discipline level and/or type the ruling applies to (if any),
    eg. prefix with `[PRO] [COMBAT]` if the ruling applies only to the card played in combat at superior Protean.

-   Adapt the ruling wording to the cards it applies to (ie. use masculine/feminin forms).
    For group rulings, ensure the statement's neutrality to make sure it reads well on every card of the group.

-   You can run the tests with the `pytest` command to check everything is OK
