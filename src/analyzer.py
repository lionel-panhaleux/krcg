        Fetch `self.examples` decks from TWDA.

        If card names are given as args, only examples containing similar cards
        are selected as examples and `self.affinity` is computed for all given cards.

        Similarity is used to select example decks from TWDA.
        A default similarity of 60% (6 out of 10 cards matching) is used to select
        example decks for the `build_deck` feature.
        When trying to find decks containing specific cards,
        similarity=1 can be used to have a 100% match, meaning all cards given as
        args must be present in the deck for it to be selected as an example.

        If `self.deck` has been created (e.g. by calling `build_deck`),
        `self.average` of number played is computed for each example card
        and `self.cards_left` is set using an average of examples.

        `self.refresh_cursor` is set to the number of cards to attain before
        a new refresh is required. It is quadratic, so refreshs happen
        in O(log) of cards count.
