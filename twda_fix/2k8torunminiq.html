Deck Name: Along comes the spider

Description: This deck won the mini qualifier in Torun, a local
tournament in Warsaw, and managed to get into the final round during
the Polish ECQ.  it's a very solid deck against most archetypes, card
flow is really impressive, and it does tend to be underestimated (not
too often, but it happens).  it's also a very fun deck to play, in the
ideal setup you block out your predator while making constant pressure
on your prey.
