Martin Major (Mephistopheles)

Deck Name: mINIMAL sTYLE

Fast and aggressive rush combat. Make 1st vp asap and decide who to
stay 1 on 1 with. Follow the basic combat doctrine to backrush first
and then play without a predator.

/could need more copies of Animalism skill card. Fear of Mekhet was a
metagame choice and burned a Legendary Unmada. Wider View never showed
up when needed. Frontal Assault is pure gold!/

/my version is really not about blocking. Random intercept is good to
keep people guessing and blocking deflected bleeds/

/very solid combat package, Target Vitals and Terror Frenzy are
extremely useful/

/discarded when drawn to early and taken back into hand after a
completed Ashur Cycle in the midgame. Awesome bonus to your ousting power/
