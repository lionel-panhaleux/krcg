I have a Dream... of the Sphinx

Deck Name: One, Two (As in "one, two princes stand before you, that's

what I said now."  Spin Doctors song.)

So I think this proves that the Euro Brujah are strong even in the hands
of someone who does not know what they are doing. The deck currently has
too many votes and too much dominate. In this tournament it definitely
needed more immortal grapple. People just kept running away. The flow of
the deck is pretty poor as it is written. I may try more combat. I also
could not get in as many fights as I would like so maybe a haven or
additional bums rushes would be nice.
