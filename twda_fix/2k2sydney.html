Days of the Dead - Qualifier for the 2002 Australian Championship

Deck Name: Rutor's Followers

Some bleed, some bloat and plenty of stealth. If things are going well
summon Qufur or Samat and Rutor them. If not, summon Hesha, load up
with blood dolls, the razor and a secure haven and survive until
things get better. Amam and Jake are great to throw in front of rush
combat. Plus it's ok if a few vamps go to torpor because you can
bring them out easily with humanitas and catacombs. Nice if you can
get either on a secured vamp early. Bloat is pretty much the only
defence against votes and bleed but with a small library the deck
moves quickly and you can be gaining 3-4 pool a turn before other
players become threatening.
