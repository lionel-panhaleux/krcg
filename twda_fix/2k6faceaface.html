Deck Name: Godzilla

This deck is a mass bruise bleed deck. The secret is to threaten
your predator (even torporise a few of his minions) and keep him
out of your way right from the beginning (with you first hatchling):
you have enough ousting power. After that he'll leave you alone.
That's what the haven uncovered and bum's rush are for.

This deck attracts a lot of attention so don't get greedy. Split
table VPs as soon as you can otherwise the table will team against
you.  Divide to better reign !

The core of this deck is the 42 combat cards. Do not go under !
As for the hatchlings, 14 is a good number... Especially with the added
thin-blooded seers. 13 masters and 5 trifles is a lot. . Fame and
Anarch troublemaker were very useful. Could remove some stealth and
add more rockhearts.

Ps: took the risks of being voted out by cards like anarchist uprising
but preferred the tributes instead of the DI s.
