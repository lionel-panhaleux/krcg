2x Blood Doll
1x Direct Intervention
1x Hungry Coyote, The      -- after the tournament I have decided that the Jakes are enough for this and that my minions have always better actions to do rather than hunt. I would change it for a Pentex "anti helena/Lucas halton/..." Subversion

4x Palla Grande
2x Vicissitude

Action (29)
9x Art Scam
3x Embrace, The            -- extremely useful for bleed and multiple action as rescuing from torpor/eating alive/rush walls
9x Enchant Kindred
3x Entrancement            -- To defend my omelettes, for bleeding or for an extrarecruitment if ever able, this card is so great
5x Summoning, The          -- key, essential, If you summon a WG and the action is blocked you don't lose the Meat machine so you could try it later, and it also multiplies the number of getting a WG from my library
