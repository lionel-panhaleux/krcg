Deck Name: Now For the Main Event - Zombies!!!

Description: Overwhelm the table with your need for tasty brains.

Pretty obvious choices here.  Le Dinh Tho was a last-minute
substitution for a 3rd Isabel.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have won
without him.

Yet again I make my deck too big.  This should've been in the 70-80 card range.
I never came close to running out of cards and there were certainly
some key cards I wanted to draw.

Pretty standard "don't block me" package.  Could've been more cards,
but since the action starts at 1 stealth (2 with Andrea), this was
sufficient.  I used the Spectral Divinations for intercept more than
once.

These events worked out very well.  I was lucky in drawing them early
every round.  Dragonbound helped me gain almost every VP all day.  Six
cards in hand is plenty for a Horde deck since I don't rely on any
combat combos.  Unmasking was discarded in round 3, but was critical in
round 2 and the final.  FBI Special Affairs Division is just huge.  It
makes a Horde with 1 life very useful indeed.  I actually didn't rack
up very many counters on it.  It mostly served as a deterrant.

I had meant to replace 3 Deflections with Redirections to save blood,
but I forgot.  Don't know if that would've made a difference.  The
bounce was crucial in round 2 and the final but useless in rounds 1 and
3.  Only played Poison Pill once and it didn't change the outcome of
the referendum.  I keep trying with this card, but I've yet to have any
positive outcome.  The only nice thing is the Hordes can play it.

2x Acquired Ventrue Assets -- Great card for this deck.
1x Barrens, The            -- Got it early in almost every round.
2x Blood Doll              -- I'm something of a Blood Doll addict, so it was kind of scary playing with only two of them. Worked out well, though.
1x Charisma
1x Creepshow Casino        -- Never really needed it, but I didn't face heavy intercept.
1x Dreams of the Sphinx    -- Gave me a turn 2 Andrea twice.
2x Fame                    -- Can't live without it.
1x Giant's Blood           -- Played it right before Oscar was going to play his in the finals.
1x Jake Washington         -- Great with Unmasking + FBI or just eat him for the blood.
1x KRCG News Radio         -- Never needed it.
1x Morgue Hunting Ground
1x Path of Bone, The       -- This was nice, but not crucial.
1x Perfectionist
1x Specialization          -- I was surprised, but I hardly got any use out of this at all. I figured in a deck with 18 of the same card, this would be a killer. It ended up being practically useless.

Action (8)
1x Far Mastery             -- Stole a Procurer in the 3rd round.
7x Govern the Unaligned    -- Used both ways. This ended up being a good number.

Ally (20)
2x Leonardo, Mortician     -- He's better than Procurer. Don't even try to tell me otherwise!
18x Shambling Hordes       -- Good number!
