Deck Name: Imbued at Last

Description: The deck's goal is to setup as fast as you can by
depleting your library and to use Unity/Anthelios to cycle back
whatever master you need the most at the time.

It was enough. I never needed more than this.

Heart is no good when it shows up late, but this is a small price
to pay when compared to how good it is when I draw it early (it was
decisive in the final table).

I only packed the extremely necessary events, so I wouldn't draw
any extra table hate, and was lucky enough to put all 3 in play in
every game. The decks runs wonderfully with those 3 on the table.
