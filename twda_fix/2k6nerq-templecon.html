Slippery When Wet

This deck is an old friend of mine. It has been
heavily modified over the years, with the most recent
modification being the addition of dominate to the
deck. The Gangrel were the first clan that I really
got to work in casual play, many years ago. I tried it
a few times in tournaments but it lacked the speed
necessary to win a table. After the addition of
dominate for some added pressure it has been much more
effective, with several strong showings. While a good
position and some luck was key in winning the day,
this deck showed itself to be a strong competitor.
