Deck Name: Gratiano's Prima Donna

Description: Lasombra S&B for the tournament in Pittsburgh, 3/27/04

Anyway, here's the decklist. There's not much new tech in here but for some
concerted effort to keep blood on my vampires. I've found that the Hungry
Coyote is close to miraculous for keeping alive if you feel you have to
turtle up for a little while,and it's usually a turn well spent hunting
with the HC around to recoup some blood spent on Dominate bleeds.

Possible improvements:

Drop one Kassiym from an extra copy of Banjoko, add an extra Path
and reduce the number of Stone Travels for some extra combat defence.
Maybe drop the prayer cards (Dramatic Upheaval, Graverobbing) and try
to find some more Shroud of Absence... As it is, though, the deck
performs well and cycles beautifully. True combat as a predator will
likely crunch it, but true combat has to go upstream heavily or it won't
survive, so you may be able to just sit it out for a while until
the coast is clear.
