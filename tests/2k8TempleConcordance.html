Deck Name: Howling Anarchs
Description: Continuing in my quest to with a tournament with
every clan alphabetically, I had to put together an Ahrimanes
deck.  I hadn't ever played them much and generally felt like
they were a decent clan, but Howler always goes to torpor, so
that's a pretty major liability.  I asked for some advice on
the #vtes irc chat and eventually jhattara gave me the idea of
playing your traditional blocking felines with some Anarch Revolts
to speed the table up.  Great idea!  Still not having much experience
with Ahrmanes, I basically copied David Quinonero's famous deck
and shoehorned some Anarch Revolts.  It turned out pretty well,
if a little slow.  I won my first round by the skin of my teeth
and had to settle for a 2-2 split in the 2nd as my prey sort of
ran away with the table.  The deck was ideal for the more
deliberately-played final and I won with 2.5VP.

1x Dani		    2	ani			Nosferatu antitribu:2
1x Gillian Krader   2	ani dem			Pander:2

/* I decided to throw a couple small guys in, but in general
they weren't super helpful.  The deck is basically Howler
with maybe The Siamese or Cynthia filling in if Howler is
unwilling or unable to perform her duties. */

Library (90)
Master [19]
1x Anarch Free Press, The
/* Not free and doesn't provide a press.  Can we get some
errata?  The one time I tried to play this it was Suddened. */
4x Anarch Revolt
1x Animalism
2x Direct Intervention
1x Fame
1x Giant's Blood
1x Guardian Angel
1x Rack, The
1x Seattle Committee
1x Smiling Jack, The Anarch
5x Vessel

/* The Anarch Revolts and Fame were responsible for both my
game wins.  I think I nailed a couple Blood Dolls with Vessels,
but I mostly included them over Blood Dolls because I was
worried about master hand jam. */

Action [11]
1x Aranthebes, The Immortal
6x Enchant Kindred
4x Nose of the Hound

/* Didn't need Aranthebes because of a lack of weenie predators.
I mostly played the Enchant Kindreds at inferior, so they might've
been better bleed cards (Legal, Social, Entrancement?).  4x Nose
of the Hound was pretty nice. */

Combat/Action Modifier [5]
5x Swiftness of the Stag

/* Okay, so I actually got my firsts ousts in the games I
won by bleeding for 2 at 1 stealth, but I like to think the
Anarch Revolts and Fame are what got me there.  These were
pretty good for keeping things up close and personal with
Flash Harrison. */

Equipment [1]
1x Flak Jacket

/* Never when I needed it.  Sigh.  Same with the Guardian Angel. */

Event [1]
1x Dragonbound

/* This was mostly only good for backousting Jesse when he
wouldn't let Howler out of a Pentex. */

Reaction [22]
4x Cats' Guidance
4x Falcon's Eye
3x On the Qui Vive
3x Sense the Savage Way
8x Speak with Spirits

/* I nearly lost the first game because I just couldn't draw
any untap or intercept and my prey was getting away with murder
for it.  It's weird because this looks like plenty to me. */

Retainer [11]
6x Murder of Crows
1x Owl Companion
4x Raven Spy

/* The Murders are pretty good here in that they make up for
the fact that the support crew have inferior Animalism (not
too scary on its own) and let Howler save on blood by doing
a good amount of damage from long range. */

Combat [20]
5x Aid from Bats
2x Canine Horde
3x Carrion Crows
8x Pack Alpha
2x Taste of Vitae

/* Pretty light combat package, especially since 8 of those
cards don't actually do anything to hurt the opponent or
protect my minion.  The deck obviously relies heavily on
Howler's natural abilities and whatever permanents it can
put together.  Some Leapfrog or Majesty or something might've
been good, but I didn't feel like there was room for it
and it was more important to be able to hurt opposing minions. */
