    POT/DOM is always good.  Let's add permanent rush, +strength,

    You can see from the crypt that an important part of playing this deck
    is being incredibly lucky.  I drew Beast in three out of four games and
    I drew Julio in every one.  How'd I get so lucky?  Dunno, I got a horrible
    crypt draw in a casual game on Friday.

    I've discussed some of the combat above and in other threads.
    In many ways, it's your basic Potence package.  The key is the guys with
    +strength.  The first time they beat someone down, they'll need a few
    cards (or a lot of cards) to do so.  After that, a Grapple might not
    even be necessary.  Pure goodness.

    An earlier version of the deck used Guardian Angels to avoid agg pokes
    and similar, but I took them out of the final version reasoning that most
    of the combat I see in tournaments is potence combat or guns and also that
    considering the expense of my minions, my masters should gain me pool, not
    cost pool.  I also had some Gang Tactics in an earlier version just because
    I think the art on them is hysterical and they're kind of useful.
    They were ultimately dropped for maneuvers because it seems more useful to
    me to be able to hold the maneuvers and play them in combat as needed than
    it is to assume I'll want close range on a certain action.  Now that I've
    won a tournament with this deck, I might put them back in just for fun.

            Comments:  Many thanks to Fred Scott for lending me 2 Tupdogs for this
            tournament.   Generally, I have found a 2.5:1 Tupdog-to-!Tremere ratio
            to work out pretty well, though a long string of Dogs at the top pf
            one's crypt is frustrating.

            The objective for this deck is to get additional mileage from the
            Tupdogs...decreasing their effective cost from 1 pool per action to
            0.5 pool per action and further leveraging both the rush and the slave
            option (rush first, untap, available for slave clause, take an action
            of the slave clause is not needed).

            The deck is supposed to carry 1 more Ashur Tablet, but I seem to own
            only 5 at this time.  4, 6 or 7 seem like the right numbers to me,
            depending on your risk tolerance and recycling needs.

            Synergies:
            Carver's + Dragonbound and Carver's + Vessel are pretty clear.
            Carver's + Raw Recruit is an indefinate hold on a Recruit target (that
            could not be Graverobbed).  Carver's not affecting Tupdogs is a bonus.

            Heidleburg can save master vampires from dangerous hunting
            requirements, can empty a Tupdog of before it explodes and allows 2
            Hand of Conrad actions per turn.

            a "good" combat ran "set close and agg hands, grapple, prevent and
