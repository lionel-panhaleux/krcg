    Description: POT/DOM is always good.  Let's add permanent rush, +strength,
    Nosferatu Kingdom and a bad attitude!

    You can see from the crypt that an important part of playing this deck
    is being incredibly lucky.  I drew Beast in three out of four games and
    I drew Julio in every one.  How'd I get so lucky?  Dunno, I got a horrible
    crypt draw in a casual game on Friday.

    I've discussed some of the combat above and in other threads.
    In many ways, it's your basic Potence package.  The key is the guys with
    +strength.  The first time they beat someone down, they'll need a few
    cards (or a lot of cards) to do so.  After that, a Grapple might not
    even be necessary.  Pure goodness.

    An earlier version of the deck used Guardian Angels to avoid agg pokes
    and similar, but I took them out of the final version reasoning that most
    of the combat I see in tournaments is potence combat or guns and also that
    considering the expense of my minions, my masters should gain me pool, not
    cost pool.  I also had some Gang Tactics in an earlier version just because
    I think the art on them is hysterical and they're kind of useful.
    They were ultimately dropped for maneuvers because it seems more useful to
    me to be able to hold the maneuvers and play them in combat as needed than
    it is to assume I'll want close range on a certain action.  Now that I've
    won a tournament with this deck, I might put them back in just for fun.

            Comments:  Many thanks to Fred Scott for lending me 2 Tupdogs for this
            tournament.   Generally, I have found a 2.5:1 Tupdog-to-!Tremere ratio
            to work out pretty well, though a long string of Dogs at the top pf
            one's crypt is frustrating.

            The objective for this deck is to get additional mileage from the
            Tupdogs...decreasing their effective cost from 1 pool per action to
            0.5 pool per action and further leveraging both the rush and the slave
            option (rush first, untap, available for slave clause, take an action
            of the slave clause is not needed).

            The deck is supposed to carry 1 more Ashur Tablet, but I seem to own
            only 5 at this time.  4, 6 or 7 seem like the right numbers to me,
            depending on your risk tolerance and recycling needs.

            Synergies:
            Carver's + Dragonbound and Carver's + Vessel are pretty clear.
            Carver's + Raw Recruit is an indefinate hold on a Recruit target (that
            could not be Graverobbed).  Carver's not affecting Tupdogs is a bonus.

            Heidleburg can save master vampires from dangerous hunting
            requirements, can empty a Tupdog of before it explodes and allows 2
            Hand of Conrad actions per turn.

            a "good" combat ran "set close and agg hands, grapple, prevent and

        "comments": """Final round recap written by Darby Keeney:

Jay (3rd seed, Matasuntha multiaction) --> Karl (2nd seed, Palla Grande Undue Influence)
  --> Marshall (5th seed, Valkyrie bleed)
  --> Darby (1st seed, Blood Deprivation/Tempt)
  --> Tim (4th seed, Prince politics with Rabbat kicker).

The mind games start even before the first transfer. Jay's 3rd seed placement
was conventional, but Karl wants nothing to do with Temptation. That part of
his plan works, Darby won't sit near Jay and instead plans to exploit the
Valkyrie's almost-slave status.

The early game proceeds as expected with Karl dropping a couple of early bleed
bombs. Subsequent rushes from Matasuntha and a Valkyrie pretty much doom him.

The key interactions defining the game's development:
  - Tim passes Jay's Ancient Influence, netting Jay 3 more beads than anyone
    else and giving him a large safety margin.
  - Matasuntha's early 1-pt bleed gets bounced with My Enemy's Enemy but Tim
    throws it back at Karl, requiring a second MEE. The pool loss is
    insignificant, but using the 2nd bounce gets Matasuntha an Enkil Cog one
    turn earlier.

On the other side of the table, Darby sprinkles Disease counters and
Temptations liberally. Marshall starts to bleed with the Valks, facing bleed
reduction and S:CE lockdown. With three players now leaning left, Jay simply
moves faster at a minion-less Karl and gets the first oust.

Things tilt in the 4-player as Jay makes it clear that Marshall will face no
predation, immediately Rewilding Darby's Heidleburg Castle. The action is
blocked but the shape of the endgame is clearly defined. Darby isn't happy
about having a pair of predators, especially since Mataunta has both the Eye of
Hazimel and Enkil Cog.

Marshall shows down for a turn and Matasuntha gets flat-out burned with Society
of Leopold. Jay has tons of pool and the Ecoterrorists, so Matasuntha V2 gets
beads as Marshall and Darby do bleedy things, leading to Tim getting ousted.

Marshall correctly Rewilds the Heidleburg (instead of Jay's Ecoterrorists) and
Darby loses an Impundulu with 4 life in a Trapped combat. Neither is completely
happy with that outcome, but Darby's resources are getting thin. Despite a
hectic last turn, Darby can't quite defend his sole pool counter, but Marshall
taps out getting it.

Matasunta immediately rushes Brunhilde and some chump eats her, setting
Marshall on Jay's earlier path of "it's time for V2." He has planned ahead and
only loses one turn - but that's enough to cause the game to time out.

Jay mentions that Marshall wins the game with 5 more minutes since Matasuntha
V1 lost some important tools. Without that time available, Jay gleefully
accepts the dubious honor of winning a tournament with exactly zero games wins
for the day.
