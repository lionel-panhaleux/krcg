Deck Name: Sauce or GTFO

Final round recap written by Darby Keeney:

Jay (3rd seed, Matasuntha multiaction) --> Karl (2nd seed, Palla Grande Undue Influence)
  --> Marshall (5th seed, Valkyrie bleed)
  --> Darby (1st seed, Blood Deprivation/Tempt)
  --> Tim (4th seed, Prince politics with Rabbat kicker).

The mind games start even before the first transfer. Jay's 3rd seed placement
was conventional, but Karl wants nothing to do with Temptation. That part of
his plan works, Darby won't sit near Jay and instead plans to exploit the
Valkyrie's almost-slave status.

The early game proceeds as expected with Karl dropping a couple of early bleed
bombs. Subsequent rushes from Matasuntha and a Valkyrie pretty much doom him.

The key interactions defining the game's development:
  - Tim passes Jay's Ancient Influence, netting Jay 3 more beads than anyone
    else and giving him a large safety margin.
  - Matasuntha's early 1-pt bleed gets bounced with My Enemy's Enemy but Tim
    throws it back at Karl, requiring a second MEE. The pool loss is
    insignificant, but using the 2nd bounce gets Matasuntha an Enkil Cog one
    turn earlier.

On the other side of the table, Darby sprinkles Disease counters and
Temptations liberally. Marshall starts to bleed with the Valks, facing bleed
reduction and S:CE lockdown. With three players now leaning left, Jay simply
moves faster at a minion-less Karl and gets the first oust.

Things tilt in the 4-player as Jay makes it clear that Marshall will face no
predation, immediately Rewilding Darby's Heidleburg Castle. The action is
blocked but the shape of the endgame is clearly defined. Darby isn't happy
about having a pair of predators, especially since Mataunta has both the Eye of
Hazimel and Enkil Cog.

Marshall shows down for a turn and Matasuntha gets flat-out burned with Society
of Leopold. Jay has tons of pool and the Ecoterrorists, so Matasuntha V2 gets
beads as Marshall and Darby do bleedy things, leading to Tim getting ousted.

Marshall correctly Rewilds the Heidleburg (instead of Jay's Ecoterrorists) and
Darby loses an Impundulu with 4 life in a Trapped combat. Neither is completely
happy with that outcome, but Darby's resources are getting thin. Despite a
hectic last turn, Darby can't quite defend his sole pool counter, but Marshall
taps out getting it.

Matasunta immediately rushes Brunhilde and some chump eats her, setting
Marshall on Jay's earlier path of "it's time for V2." He has planned ahead and
only loses one turn - but that's enough to cause the game to time out.

Jay mentions that Marshall wins the game with 5 more minutes since Matasuntha
V1 lost some important tools. Without that time available, Jay gleefully
accepts the dubious honor of winning a tournament with exactly zero games wins
for the day.
