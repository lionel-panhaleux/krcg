Deck Name: Imbued at Last
Description: The deck's goal is to setup as fast as you can by
depleting your library and to use Unity/Anthelios to cycle back
whatever master you need the most at the time.

Library (60)
Action [1]
1x Aranthebes, The Immortal

Ally [3]
1x Carlton Van Wyk (Hunter)
1x Ossian
1x Wendell Delburton (Hunter)

Conviction [14]
4x React with Conviction
5x Second Sight
5x Strike with Conviction
-- It was enough. I never needed more than this.

Equipment [3]
1x Crusader Sword, The
1x Heart of Nizchetus
1x Ivory Bow
-- Heart is no good when it shows up late, but this is a small price
to pay when compared to how good it is when I draw it early (it was
decisive in the final table).

Event [3]
1x Anthelios, The Red Star
1x Edge Explosion
1x Unmasking, The
-- I only packed the extremely necessary events, so I wouldn't draw
any extra table hate, and was lucky enough to put all 3 in play in
every game. The decks runs wonderfully with those 3 on the table.

Master [25]
2x Angel of Berlin
1x Barrens, The
1x Church of Vindicated Faith, The
1x Direct Intervention - saved me a lot of times, unfortunately
I couldn't pack more than one.
1x Fortschritt Library
6x Memories of Mortality
1x Millicent Smith, Puritan Vampire Hunter - no comments needed.
3x Parthenon, The
1x Rötschreck
4x Slaughterhouse, The - useful either to speed deck depletion
or to trade for something useful under Anthelios.
1x Smiling Jack, The Anarch - crucial contest in the final table.
1x Tension in the Ranks
1x Unity
1x Wash - not as effective as I expected, but also not a hassle
because it's trifle.

Power [8]
2x Champion
2x Discern
1x Rejuvenate
3x Vigilance - I started to win a game when I had those three in play.

Reaction [3]
3x Determine
